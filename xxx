==== Daphile

Daphile is a Linux embedded-like OS for bit-perfect audio playback.
According to its creator
https://www.diyaudio.com/community/threads/daphile-audiophile-music-server-player-os.240040/[Kipeta]
on diyaudio.com, it will run in a very low memory environment:

Hard disk is not required. You can run it perfectly fine from 2GB USB
Flash Drive….I would recommend something like Atom N2600 (with 1GB RAM
or maybe 2GB). It's really low power CPU. I have used by myself the
Jetway JBC362F36W-2600-B which is very nice fanless barebone and its
Wifi module supports WLAN hotspot (hostapd) functionality. +
